      work.

An organization does NOT qualify if its primary activities include:

        targeting private individuals, advocacy organizations, or
        political opponents rather than investigating matters of
        genuine public interest;

        political campaign, political action committee, or government

  (iii) Systematic harassment, doxxing, or intimidation of private
        individuals, including through selective or deceptive editing
        of recorded material;
  (iv)  Operating under the direction or financial control of a
        political party, government agency, or intelligence service;
  (v)   Presenting news-themed entertainment, commentary, or opinion
        programming as journalism, particularly where the organization
        or its representatives have asserted in legal proceedings,
        regulatory filings, or public statements that its content
        does not constitute factual reporting, should not be taken as
        statements of fact, or is intended as entertainment or opinion
        rather than news.
